## About The Project

Resume intelligently analyzes resumes and compares them against specific job descriptions, identifying the best resume based on job description keywords. This saves users valuable time and resources.

### Built With

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This project requires Yarn to be installed in your system. If you don&#39;t have it installed, you can follow these steps:

- Install Yarn globally using npm (Node Package Manager). Open your terminal and run:

  ```sh
  npm install -g yarn
  ```

  Please ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed before running Yarn.

- Verify that Yarn has been installed on your machine by running the following command in your terminal:

  ```sh
  yarn --version
  ```

  If Yarn has been installed correctly, your terminal should display the version of Yarn installed on your machine.

Now you are ready to use Yarn for managing and versioning your project dependencies!

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository** 

  ```sh
  git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/venoblin/scripts
  ```

2. **Create settings file (for [ezdownloadsorter](https://github.com/venoblin/download-file-sorter))**

  ```sh
